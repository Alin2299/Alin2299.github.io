# Welcome

Hi - I’m Andrew. I’m currently studying philosophy, politics, and economics at the University of Waikato, having previously completed undergraduate and Honours study in Computer Science and Data Analytics.  
Outside of my studies, I’m interested in reading and gaming, trying new things, spending time outdoors, sport, and travel, alongside a wide range of other pursuits.

This website serves as a simple overview of my background, interests, and current work. 
I value being a well-rounded generalist, and I hope this site gives a clear sense of how my academic and personal interests fit together.

To get in touch, please see the *Links* section below.

### Projects
In addition to exploring various topics such as econometrics, modelling, and Power BI, I am also undertaking an analysis of OIA data from the University of Waikato
related to enrolment data by various subjects, degrees, demographic attributes, and other strata.

This section will be expanded as work is completed.

### Writing
I also maintain a personal Substack largely focused on commentary, reflections, and analysis.

Find below an example of my current flagship piece, which explores the issue of work hours and flexibility in NZ, from a policy, economic, sociological, and personal perspective.
To view the full piece and others, please see my Substack in the *Links* section.
